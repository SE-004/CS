Sets
====

### Activity 1: Unique Words

1.  Convert the list `groceries` to a set to remove duplicates and store it in a new variabled named `shopping_list`.
2.  Print the set.
    

### Activity 2: Add And Remove

1.  Add thåree new items to the set `shopping_list` and print it.
    
2.  Remove the item `sugar` from the `shopping_list` and print it.
    
3.  Remove a random item from the `shopping_list` and print it.
    
4.  Add `honey` to the `shopping_list`.
    
5.  Remove with a loop 3 random values of the `shopping_list`.
    
6.  Print the `shopping_list`.
    

### Activity 3: Set Operations

1.  Create two sets: `a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and `b = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`.
    
2.  Create a new set called `union` and stored the joined values of `a` and `b`.
    
3.  Print `union`.
    
4.  Create the variable `intersection` and store the numbers that are inlcuded in `a` and `b`.
    
5.  Print `intersection`.
    
6.  Create two new variable named `difference_a` and `difference_b` and store in each one the unique numbers in set `a` and in set `b` respectively.
    
7.  Print both `difference_a` and `difference_b`.
    

### Activity 4: Set Membership

1.  Create a variable name `even` and use [range](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp "Range in Python") to create a set of even numbers between 0 and 20 as its value.
    
2.  Create a variable named `random_int` and use the random module to asign a random integer between 0 and 20.
    
3.  Check if `random_int` exists in the set `even`.
    
4.  Print the result of the check.
    
5.  Run the code several times to see if the result of the check is different.
