# 1.  #### Create the variables: 
    
#     *   `alphabet` - pass a string with all of the letters o the alphabet as its value.
        
#     *   `phone_book` - an empty dictionary.
        
# 2.  #### Create an entry for each letter of the alphabet in the dictionary:
    
#     *   The key should be named after the letter of the alphabet capitalize.
        
#     *   The value should be an empty dictionary.
        
# 3.  #### Print: 
    
#     *   The `phone_book`.
        
#     *   All the keys in the `phone_book`.
        
# 4.  #### Add inside the key `"A"`: 
    
#     *   Three key-value pairs. 
        
#     *   Each key should be the name of a person.
        
#     *   Each value should be a phone number.
        
# 5.  #### Print: 
    
#     *   All the names inside the `"A"` dictionary.
        
#     *   Print all the phones in the dictionary `"A"`.
        
#     *   The `"A"` dictionary.
        
# 6.  #### Repeat the last two step for the dictionaries inside `"C"`, `"M"` and `"P"`.
    
# 7.  #### Print all keys in the `phone_book`.
