# 1. Create a Tuple
# Create a variable named my_tuple and assign it a tuple containing at least 5 items (they can be strings, numbers, or a mix).

# 2. Print the Tuple
# Use the print() function to display the contents of my_tuple.

# 3. Access Tuple Items
# Print the first item of the tuple using an index of 0.
# Print the last item of the tuple using a negative index.

# 4. Slice the Tuple
# Print a slice of the tuple that includes some middle items

# Print a slice that goes from the start of the tuple up to a certain index

# Print a slice that starts at a certain index and goes to the end

# 5.Check if an Item Exists
# Use the in keyword to check if a certain item exists in my_tuple.

# Print a message indicating whether the item is found.

# 6. Count and Index
# Use the count() method to find how many times a specific value appears in my_tuple.

# Use the index() method to find the position of the first occurrence of that value.

# 7. Packing and Unpacking
# Packing: Youâ€™ve already packed the tuple by assigning multiple values to my_tuple.

# Unpacking: Unpack my_tuple into separate variables so that each variable corresponds to an item in the tuple 

# Use the asterisk (*) in another unpacking scenario 

# 8. Joining Tuples
# Create another tuple named another_tuple with a few items.

# Concatenate my_tuple and another_tuple using the + operator. Print the result.

# Multiply one of your tuples by an integer and print the result to see the repeated items.
